    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Dr. Shady Adib is a PhD candidate in the Civil Engineering department at the University of Newcastle, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. His doctoral research leverages the rapid advancement of digital technology and data-driven approaches to innovate real-time damage identification in infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Dr. Adib's PhD research focuses on the development of the Digital Twin (DT) concept, which integrates mathematical and data-driven approaches for monitoring and managing the health of structures. By combining the Reduced Basis (RB) method and Deep Learning (DL) technology, his research aims at detecting abnormal changes in structural behaviour in real-time. This innovative approach addresses model uncertainties and synchronises physical and virtual models using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.</p>
        <p>Before his PhD, Dr. Adib completed his master’s degree in Structural Engineering (2017-2019) at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Vilnius, Lithuania, focusing on structural analysis, design, and application of high-strength steel cold-formed tubular beams. He also holds a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering (2012-2017) from the German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt, where he concentrated on comparing reinforced concrete and steel structures.</p>
