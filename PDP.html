        <h1>Personal Development Plan (2026–2027)</h1>

        <h2>Strategic Objective</h2>
        <p>
            To deepen my intellectual, technical, and entrepreneurial leadership in Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twin
            systems by integrating systems thinking, design philosophy, and product transformation within the AEC industry.
            This development phase focuses on bridging advanced research with scalable, real-world deployment.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Development Themes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Philosophy &amp; Systems Thinking in AI and Digital Twins:</strong><br>
                Studying the epistemological and design foundations of AI-driven systems, including system architecture,
                cyber-physical integration, autonomy, human-in-the-loop governance, and lifecycle intelligence. Exploring
                Digital Twins not only as monitoring tools, but as adaptive, decision-making ecosystems.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Design-Oriented Digital Twin Architecture:</strong><br>
                Advancing modular, scalable Digital Twin architectures from a systems-design perspective, focusing on
                interoperability, resilience, and product-ready frameworks tailored for AEC environments.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>From Research to Product (AEC Productisation):</strong><br>
                Transforming Digital Twin methodologies into deployable products within the Architecture, Engineering, and
                Construction (AEC) sector. This includes SaaS modelling, lifecycle-based value capture, user experience design,
                scalability, and commercial adoption strategies.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Advanced AI &amp; Generative Systems:</strong><br>
                Expanding expertise in Generative AI, Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML), diffusion models, and
                explainable AI to support adaptive and predictive infrastructure systems.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>IoE, Edge Intelligence &amp; Real-Time Systems:</strong><br>
                Enhancing applied knowledge in embedded systems, IoT architectures, and edge-based AI for scalable,
                low-bandwidth infrastructure deployment.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Certifications &amp; Professional Recognition (Planned)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chartered Engineer (CEng)</li>
            <li>Project Management Professional (PMP)</li>
            <li>Certified AI Practitioner (CAIP)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research &amp; Product Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop a structured framework for Self-Generating and Autonomous Digital Twins.</li>
            <li>Publish work exploring the philosophy and systems design of AI-driven infrastructure ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Translate Digital Twin research into scalable product architectures for AEC deployment.</li>
            <li>Advance modular lifecycle-based Digital Twin platforms suitable for emerging markets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>
        <p>
            To contribute to redefining Digital Twins as intelligent, adaptive, and product-oriented infrastructure systems —
            shifting the field from dashboard-based monitoring to autonomous lifecycle optimisation within the AEC industry.
