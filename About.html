        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Dr. Shady Adib, PhD, AFHEA, a Civil Engineer specialising in Digital Twin technology, AI-driven Structural Health Monitoring, and innovative infrastructure solutions. I completed my doctorate at Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, where my research focused on integrating advanced machine learning models with Digital Twins for real-time damage detection and infrastructure resilience.</p>

        <p>I am currently a <strong>Visiting Researcher at University College London (UCL), UK</strong>, where I work on self-generating digital twins and their applications in infrastructure resilience. Alongside this role, I serve as a <strong>part-time Assistant Professor in Civil Engineering at the University of Hertfordshire, hosted by its Global Academic Foundation (GAF) campus in Egypt</strong>, where I teach and supervise students on emerging topics in digital transformation of the built environment.</p>

        <p>I am also a member and Research Associate at the Africa Center for Digital Transformation (ACDT), where I contribute to developing adaptive, climate-resilient infrastructure systems using Digital Twin frameworks. My work with ACDT involves leveraging generative AI, physics-informed machine learning, and real-time data to support transparent, accountable decision-making in critical infrastructure projects across Africa, with a focus on enhancing bridge resilience in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana. Additionally, I serve as a session lead for the TechForward Policy Fellowship, guiding discussions on Digital Public Infrastructure and ICT Infrastructure in Africa, where I integrate both technical insights and policy perspectives to shape the future of resilient, data-driven systems across the continent.</p>
        
        <p>My PhD research focused on the development of the Digital Twin (DT) concept by creating a hybrid DT, which integrates mathematical and data-driven approaches for monitoring and managing the health of structures. By combining the Reduced Basis (RB) method and Deep Learning (DL) technology, my research aimed at detecting abnormal changes in structural behaviour in real-time. This innovative approach addresses model uncertainties and synchronises physical and virtual models using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.</p>
        
        <p>Before my PhD, I completed a master’s degree in Structural Engineering (2017-2019) at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Vilnius, Lithuania, with a focus on structural analysis, design, and the application of high-strength steel cold-formed tubular beams. I also hold a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering (2012-2017) from the German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt, where I concentrated on comparing reinforced concrete and steel structures.</p>
