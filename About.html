        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Shady Adib, a PhD candidate in the Civil Engineering department at the University of Newcastle, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. My doctoral research leverages the rapid advancement of digital technology and data-driven approaches to innovate real-time damage identification in infrastructure.</p>
        
        <p>My PhD research focuses on the development of the Digital Twin (DT) concept by creating a hybrid DT, which integrates mathematical and data-driven approaches for monitoring and managing the health of structures. By combining the Reduced Basis (RB) method and Deep Learning (DL) technology, my research aims at detecting abnormal changes in structural behaviour in real-time. This innovative approach addresses model uncertainties and synchronises physical and virtual models using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.</p>
        
        <p>Before my PhD, I completed a master’s degree in Structural Engineering (2017-2019) at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Vilnius, Lithuania, with a focus on structural analysis, design, and the application of high-strength steel cold-formed tubular beams. I also hold a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering (2012-2017) from the German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt, where I concentrated on comparing reinforced concrete and steel structures.</p>
