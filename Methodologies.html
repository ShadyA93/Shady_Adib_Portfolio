        <h3>1. Development of Hybrid Digital Twin for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)</h3>
        <p>
            The first major PhD project involved developing a hybrid model combining advanced modeling techniques, RB space, and a data-driven approach using deep learning. The goal was to create an accurate and efficient DT framework for real-time SHM. This project focused on integrating:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Finite Element Analysis (FEA):</strong> FEA was employed to simulate structural behaviour under various loading conditions, serving as the foundational physical model for the RB space establishment.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Modelling Techniques:</strong> Model Reduction Techniques (MOR), particularly RB methods, were utilised to reduce the computational complexity of large-scale structural models, allowing for real-time simulation and faster decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Data-Driven Approach:</strong> A data-driven approach, primarily through deep learning, was incorporated to enhance the predictive capabilities of the DT.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning for Real-Time Structural Damage Identification:</strong> Deep learning algorithms were integrated to provide advanced anomaly detection by learning from RB snapshots used as datasets for the network.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>2. Development of a Cost-Effective IoT Solution for SHM</h3>
        <p>
            The second PhD project involved designing and implementing a cost-effective Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for IoT-based SHM.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardware Development:</strong> Focused on designing a low-cost, energy-efficient PCB to gather real-time structural data.</li>
            <li><strong>DT Synchronisation:</strong> Ensured that the physical data collected by the PCB through sensors could be integrated into the DT in real-time.</li>
        </ul>
